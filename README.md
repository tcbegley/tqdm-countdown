# tqdm-countdown

Ever been monitoring the progress of your code but felt like there just wasn't enough tension? Well, tqdm-countdown is here to help! It creates a tqdm progress bar that plays the countdown music from the UK TV show Countdown when there is 30 seconds left to go on your progress bar. Cheer on your code as it races to complete its task before the UK's tensest game show music finishes playing.

## FAQ

**Q: Is there a performance penalty to using this over `tqdm`?** Probably? But it's way more fun, and since time flies when you're having fun your code might _feel_ faster.
